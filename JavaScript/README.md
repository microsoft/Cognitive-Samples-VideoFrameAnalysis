## Getting Started

1. Get API keys for the Vision APIs from [Microsoft Cognitive Services][]. For video frame analysis, the applicable APIs are:
    - [Computer Vision API][]
    - [Face API][]
    - [Custom Vision][]

2. Open `camera.js` in any code editor (e.g. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), change `API_URL` and `API_KEY` to your desired API and the corresponding key

3. Open `LiveCameraResult.html` in any web browsers (e.g. [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge)) to run the sample and see the results!
